ROCKET FEATURES
these are all things to do on tuesday:
-for probe gui, add menu that lets you select target destination
-once target destination is set and rocket is launched, add a rocket silo to that menu
-add a way to store which planets have been unlocked (maybe in game class)
-add planet switcher that just lets you scroll through the planets and change the active planet
-add different background colours and generation algorithms to planets
-if not probe gui, same gui but if you click on a planet there has to be a rocket silo there
-need to implement some way to fill up the rocket storage tank (maybe just dont do it)




other features to add today:
- planet viewer (this will probably take a while)

TUTORIAL SYSTEM
things to do:
- add tutorial class
- write the text of each stage of the tutorial as a table text file
- figure out a way to only allow certain inputs in each tutorial stage
- make certain events trigger next tutorial stage
time taken: 5 days?

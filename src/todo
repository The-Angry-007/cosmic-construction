OPTIMISATIONS TO BE MADE
files get huge due to number of item objects in circulation
plan of attack:
-make id system just same as index into arrays
-remove any items when they enter a building if they wont be exiting it straight after
(such as in recipes, storage silo etc.)
should massively improve memory usage etc.
-fix memory leak when opening new menus

need to:
create empty chunk slots list like with items and structures
add some isdeleted attribute to chunk and stuff
basically just did everything that was done with items

THEN
make structure's id same as its index and change anywhere that iterates instead of being O(1)

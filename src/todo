OPTIMISATIONS TO BE MADE
files get huge due to number of item objects in circulation
plan of attack:
-make id system just same as index into arrays
-remove any items when they enter a building if they wont be exiting it straight after
(such as in recipes, storage silo etc.)
should massively improve memory usage etc.
-fix memory leak when opening new menus

optimisations to make:
improve the update neighbours algorithm by only updating structures that NEED to update
impelment the factorio style

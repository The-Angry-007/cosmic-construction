ITERATION 2 PLAN
things to accomplish:
audio
camera
game
item
terrain
structure
one planet
resourceHandler




FULL PLAN
x create barebones game class with update and render functions
x create basic item class that just draws a blue square in its position
x make camera class that belongs to game that can pan around and zoom
x create table with a few placeholder item names and their sprites
x create resourceHandler that loads in this info
- draw outline around items when being hovered
- add planet class to store items
- add saving and loading of items (default directory is just items)
- add chunk class and get saving and loading of chunks working
- add structure base class
- create sprites for conveyor belt and add it
- get saving and loading of structures working
- add few more structure types
- add terrain class with saving and loading
- create some terrain types
- add procedural generation to planet
- make GUI fully functional
- flesh out all the items, structures, terrain
- finish tech tree and help menu
- add sound effects and audio (maybe)


possible optimisations:
calculate accurate hitboxes for items in resource handler
draw items using vertex array instead of sprites

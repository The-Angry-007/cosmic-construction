OPTIMISATIONS TO BE MADE
files get huge due to number of item objects in circulation
plan of attack:
-make id system just same as index into arrays
-remove any items when they enter a building if they wont be exiting it straight after
(such as in recipes, storage silo etc.)
should massively improve memory usage etc.
-fix memory leak when opening new menus

UPDATED ITEM SYSTEM TO DO
x add new constructor to item class that just creates a blank item
x add some code to planet function that ensures the id of the item is the same as the index when loading in
x skip over deleted items when saving
x create add item function that replaces first deleted item,
x crate delete item function that removes item from chunk
x set id of item to that index
for storage silo, recipes etc just delete item upon entry
structures that SHOULD have items: ones where hte items are actually visible, such as conveyors
structures that should NOT: ones where the items are invisble, such as storage silos

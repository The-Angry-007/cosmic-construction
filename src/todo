OPTIMISATIONS TO BE MADE
files get huge due to number of item objects in circulation
plan of attack:
-make id system just same as index into arrays
-remove any items when they enter a building if they wont be exiting it straight after
(such as in recipes, storage silo etc.)
should massively improve memory usage etc.
